About Me
========
<br>
My family originates from Kerala, India but I was born and brought up in Gaborone, Botswana.
Before you ask, I would like to let you know that I did not ride giraffes to school.
That is just ludicrous! 
Everybody knows **you get better mileage from elephants**. 
My interests include anything related to computer science, football and formula 1.
I also ocassionally perform stand-up comedy when time permits. 
I am currently undertaking the 2<sup>nd</sup> of a 4 year Computing (MEng) degree at Imperial College London. 
For more on my (lack of a) social life, I recommend you take a look at my social media accounts listed below.
