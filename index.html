    <h1 id="about">About Me</h1>
    <p>
    My family originates from Kerala, India, but I was born and brought up in Gaborone, Botswana.
    Before you ask, I would like to let you know that I did not ride giraffes to school.
    That is just ludicrous!
    Everybody knows <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTHzlUQDGmc">you get better mileage from elephants</a>.
    My interests include anything related to computer science, football and formula 1.
    When time permits, I also perform stand-up comedy.
    I am currently undertaking the second of a 4 year Computing (MEng) degree at Imperial College London.
    For more on my (lack of a) social life, I recommend you take a look at my social media and other accounts listed below.

    <h2><a href="https://github.com/erikbabu/image_steganography">Image Steganography</a></h2>
      <h4>January 2018</h4>
      <p>
        After implementing an Enigma Machine (mentioned below), which was about making messages hard to decode,
        I wondered if there was a way of hiding messages in the open. My research pointed me towards
        image steganography. After reading a research paper on Lowest Significant Bit Image Steganography
        using colour images, I implemented a variation of the algorithm in C++. Users can store their message
        in a text file and hide this message in a provided image. The differences between the source and embedded images cannot be detected by the human eye.
        A user on the receiving end can then run the decryption algorithm on the embedded image and have the discovered text
        saved in a text file.</br>
        <b>Language used:</b> C++
      </p>
    <h2><a href="https://github.com/erikbabu/enigma_machine_sim">Enigma Machine</a></h2>
      <h4>December 2017</h4>
      <p>
        After watching the film, The Imitation Game, I became fascinated by the enigma machine
        used by Germany to encrypt and decrypt messages. After reading a bit on how it worked,
        I implemented it in C++. My implementation works exactly like the original apart from the fact
        that more than 3 rotors can be used. I also included the original rotor configurations as well
        as other configurations used throughout history to give users an authentic experience.</br>
        <b>Language used:</b> C++
      </p>
    <h2><a href="https://github.com/erikbabu/world_gdp_visualisation">World GDP Visualisation Tool</a></h2>
      <h4>December 2017</h4>
      <p>
        I had recently learnt python and wanted to practise the skills I garnered.
        I am quite fascinated by data analysis and impressed by good data visualisations.
        I decided to write my own data visualisation tool, with the aid of Pygal.
        The program allows users to input a year between 1960 and 2016 (the years data were available).
        The program then reads from the json file containing the data.
        Finally it plots the data on a pygal world map and saves the result in a svg file that can be viewed on a browser.</br>
        <b>Language used:</b> Python

    <h2>Compiler for small while language</h2>
      <h4>November 2017 - December 2017</h4>
      <p>
        Second year group project where the aim was to write a compiler for a small while language.
        The first task was to develop the front-end of the compiler (perform syntax and semantic checks).
        ANTLR was used to perform the tokenizing and parse tree generation based on the Lexer and Parser rules we provided.
        The second task was to develop the back-end of the compiler (convert valid programs into ARM11 assembly).
        For both these tasks, we wrote ruby scripts that would automate testing.
        Our extension to the language was to have classes with constructors, destructors and overloaded fields/methods with visibility.
        The front- and back-end implementations were updated to reflect this.</br>
        <b>Languages used</b>: Java with ANTLR, Ruby
      </p>
    <h2>Concurrent Picture Processing Library</h2>
      <h4>November 2017</h4>
      <p>
        Wrote a picture processing library in C++ with the aid of the opencv library.
        The task was to allow users to load several images into a library and perform operations on them such as:
        blurring, inverting, grayscaling, rotating or flipping.
        After this was done, the next task was to make the implementation concurrent.
        I had learnt some theory about concurrency in the first year,
        but this was the first time I would be applying that theory.
        To speed up the image processing, the program was updated to perform different actions on separate images concurrently.
        Additionally, images were split into sectors and had threads working on each sector to further speed up processing.</br>
        <b>Language used</b>: C++
      </p>
    <h2>Assembler for subset of ARM11 instructions</h2>
      <h4>May 2017 - June 2017</h4>
      <p>
        First year group project where the first task was to write a Raspberry PI emulator.
        The second task was to write an assembler for a subset of ARM11 instructions.
        For our extension, we wrote games with GUIs in C with the aid of the SDL Library.
        I re-made the classic arcade game, Pong.</br>
        <b>Language used</b>: C
      </p>
    <h2>Supermarket loyalty rewards system</h2>
      <h4>February 2015 - October 2015</h4>
      <p>
        A-Level project that involved creating a customer rewards system
        for an international grocery chain. The program, written in VB6.0
        gives users the option to register for the scheme. And if they are registered,
        the POS system interacts with the loyalty system to award them points for their purchases.
        When a certain number of points has been accrued, users get discounts on their purchases.
        All user information was stored in a database and lookups were made with SQL queries.</br>
        <b>Languages used</b>: VB6.0, SQL
