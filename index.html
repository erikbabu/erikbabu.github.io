    <p>
    My family originates from Kerala, India, but I was born and brought up in Gaborone, Botswana.
    Before you ask, I would like to let you know that I did not ride giraffes to school.
    That is just ludicrous!
    Everybody knows <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTHzlUQDGmc">you get better mileage from elephants</a>.
    My interests include anything related to computer science, football and Formula 1.
    When time permits, I also perform stand-up comedy.
    I am currently undertaking the penultimate year of a 4-year Computing (MEng) degree at Imperial College London.
    For more on my (lack of a) social life, I recommend you take a look at my social media and other accounts listed below.

    <h1 id="work">Work Experience</h1>

    <h2>American Express | Technology Intern Engineer | Burgess Hill, United Kingdom</h2>
    <h3 align="right">June 2018 - August 2018</h3>
     <p>
       Worked in the Loyalty sector where the assigned project was to develop a dashboard
       that would allow engineers to monitor file transfers between AmEx and a specific partner
       to determine if they were successful or not.
     </p>
     <p>
       The MVP was just meant to monitor files sent to one partner. However the developed solution
       vastly exceeded expectations by being generic enough to be used to monitor both sending and
       receiving as well as having the capability to monitor transfers to every single partner.
     </p>
     <p>
       Worked with a start-up, loyalBe, as part of the internship. Tasked with developing a REST API
       that would allow submission of feedback. Also developed a dashboard that retailers
       could use to view feedback as well as reply to it.
     </p>
     <p>
       Gained a lot of technical experience working with several new technologies
       (Redis, Logstash, ElasticSearch, Kibana, React, Spring Boot). Learnt how to
       work in an agile (scrum) environment to ensure consistent delivery of value
       after each iteration, demonstrated by the fact that the project went into
       production 2 weeks ahead of schedule.

    <h2>Handy Peters (Web Application)</h2>
      <h4>May 2018 - June 2018</h4>
      <p>
        Leader of group project where we created a Web application with the aim
        of connecting those that need help around the house, with those willing
        to help them. There was a strong emphasis on following agile practices
        for this project. In the first week, we carried out extensive research
        (surveys) to determine the viability of our idea. Next, we set up CI/CD
        and developed a walking skeleton, following a thin-sliced, iterative approach
        to adding features. Based on user-feedback (gained during meetings with users
        fitting the target demographic), we added/removed/improved existing features,
        leading to our MVP. Finally, we added the remaining features that were lower
        on the priority list but would still bring value to the users, either through
        functionality or user-experience.</br>

    <h2>Pintos</h2>
      <h4>January 2018 - March 2018</h4>
      <p>
        Second Year Group project where the aim was to implement the Pintos Operating system. The project was split into 4 tasks:
	<ol class="ordered">
          <li><b>Task 0:</b>
		  This task was done individually. It involved changing the original skeleton's implementation
		  of the clock timer's 'sleep' functionality. Changed busy waiting waiting implementation to
		  having a list of threads, descendingly ordered by their earliest wake up time. This meant
		  that more threads could run in a given time, on average.
	  </li></br>
          <li><b>Task 1:</b>
	  	  This task involved implementing scheduling algorithms. The first thing we needed to do was implement priority scheduling
                  for locks, semaphores and monitors. Once this was done, we worked on implementing priority donation for locks. Finally,
		  we implemented the BSD scheduling algorithm. Additionally, to implement BSD scheduling, we needed to create our own
		  floating-point arithmetic functions.
	  </li></br>
          <li><b>Task 2:</b>
	  	  For this task, the aim was to get pintos to be able to support loading and running user programs (written in C) i.e. interacting
		  with the OS through system calls. We also added support for passing arguments to new processes. We made sure that anything
		  unsafe that the user program attempted would be killed, thereby protecting the kernel, and allowing other user processes to run
		  without any issues.
	  </li></br>
          <li><b>Task 3:</b>
	  	  This was the most challenging task of the project. We needed to implement user virtual memory. For Task 2, every user program
		  managed to fit inside the 2MB RAM. However, for this task, we allowed user programs to "think" that they had 3GB to work with.
	          To get this done, we created a frame table and a swap table, to keep track of the current frames in physical memory and the ones
	          stored in swap space (the hard drive). The page-fault handler from the previous task was modified to also allow the stack to grow
	          larger (up to 8MB). This was significantly larger than the size of the single page (4kB) limit that was previously imposed. We used
		  the second chance eviction algorithm for our frame replacement. We tried to implement sharing of read-only pages but did not manage
		  to complete it in time. This task, much like the others, was difficult due to the small time frame we had to complete the assignment.
		  There were a lot of synchronisation cases we needed to consider to prevent deadlocks from occurring.

    <h2><a href="https://github.com/erikbabu/image_steganography">Image Steganography</a></h2>
      <h4>January 2018</h4>
      <p>
        After implementing an Enigma Machine (mentioned below), which was about making messages hard to decode,
        I wondered if there was a way of hiding messages in the open. My research pointed me towards
        image steganography. After reading a research paper on Lowest Significant Bit Image Steganography
        using colour images, I implemented a variation of the algorithm in C++. Users can store their message
        in a text file and hide this message in a provided image. The differences between the source and embedded images cannot be detected by the human eye.
        A user on the receiving end can then run the decryption algorithm on the embedded image and have the discovered text
        saved in a text file.</br>

    <h2><a href="https://github.com/erikbabu/enigma_machine_sim">Enigma Machine</a></h2>
      <h4>December 2017</h4>
      <p>
        After watching the film, The Imitation Game, I became fascinated by the enigma machine
        used by Germany to encrypt and decrypt messages. After reading a bit on how it worked,
        I implemented it in C++. My implementation works exactly like the original apart from the fact
        that more than 3 rotors can be used. I also included the original rotor configurations as well
        as other configurations used throughout history to give users an authentic experience.</br>
        <b>Languages/Frameworks used</b>: C++
      </p>
    <h2><a href="https://github.com/erikbabu/world_gdp_visualisation">World GDP Visualisation Tool</a></h2>
      <h4>December 2017</h4>
      <p>
        I had recently learnt python and wanted to practise the skills I garnered.
        I am quite fascinated by data analysis and impressed by good data visualisations.
        I decided to write my own data visualisation tool, with the aid of Pygal.
        The program allows users to input a year between 1960 and 2016 (the years data were available).
        The program then reads from the json file containing the data.
        Finally it plots the data on a pygal world map and saves the result in a svg file that can be viewed on a browser.</br>

    <h2>Compiler for small while language (WACC)</h2>
      <h4>November 2017 - December 2017</h4>
      <p>
        Second year group project where the aim was to write a full compiler for a complete, static-typed while language.
        The first task was to develop the front-end of the compiler (perform syntax and semantic checks).
        ANTLR was used to perform the tokenizing and parse tree generation based on the Lexer and Parser rules we provided.
        The second task was to develop the back-end of the compiler (convert valid programs into ARM11 assembly).
        For both these tasks, we wrote ruby scripts that would automate testing.
        Our extension to the language was to have classes with constructors, destructors and overloaded fields/methods with visibility.
        The front- and back-end implementations were updated to reflect this.</br>
        <b>Languages/Frameworks used</b>: Java with ANTLR, Ruby
      </p>
    <h2>Concurrent Picture Processing Library</h2>
      <h4>November 2017</h4>
      <p>
        Wrote a picture processing library in C++ with the aid of the opencv library.
        The task was to allow users to load several images into a library and perform operations on them such as:
        blurring, inverting, grayscaling, rotating or flipping.
        After this was done, the next task was to make the implementation concurrent.
        I had learnt some theory about concurrency in the first year,
        but this was the first time I would be applying that theory.
        To speed up the image processing, the program was updated to perform different actions on separate images concurrently.
        Additionally, images were split into sectors and had threads working on each sector to further speed up processing.</br>
        <b>Languages/Frameworks used</b>: C++

    <h2>Emulator and Assembler for subset of ARM11 instructions</h2>
      <h4>May 2017 - June 2017</h4>
      <p>
        First year group project where the first task was to write an ARM11 emulator.
        The second task was to write an ARM11 assembler.
        For our extension, we wrote games with GUIs in C with the aid of the SDL Library.
        I re-made the classic arcade game, Pong.</br>

    <h2>Supermarket loyalty rewards system</h2>
      <h4>February 2015 - October 2015</h4>
      <p>
        A-Level project that involved creating a customer rewards system
        for an international grocery chain. The program, written in VB6.0
        gives users the option to register for the scheme. And if they are registered,
        the POS system interacts with the loyalty system to award them points for their purchases.
        When a certain number of points has been accrued, users get discounts on their purchases.
        All user information was stored in a database and lookups were made with SQL queries.</br>
